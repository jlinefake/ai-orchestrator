## Current Phase: DISCOVERY

Your task is to thoroughly understand the feature requirements:

1. **Parse the Request**: Identify the core functionality being requested
2. **Identify Scope**: What components, files, or systems will be affected?
3. **List Assumptions**: What assumptions are you making about the requirements?
4. **Note Ambiguities**: What aspects need clarification?

Create a TodoWrite list with all 7 workflow phases:
1. Discovery (current)
2. Codebase Exploration
3. Clarifying Questions
4. Architecture Design
5. Implementation
6. Quality Review
7. Summary

Output a clear summary of what you understand the feature to be.
When complete, the workflow will automatically advance to Codebase Exploration.

## Current Phase: CODEBASE EXPLORATION

Three exploration agents are searching the codebase in parallel with different focuses:
1. Similar features and patterns
2. Architecture and data flow
3. User experience and APIs

After they complete:
1. Review their findings
2. Read ALL files they identified (this is required)
3. Document the patterns you discovered
4. Present a comprehensive summary of the codebase understanding

Mark 'files_identified' and 'patterns_documented' complete when done.

## Current Phase: CLARIFYING QUESTIONS

**CRITICAL: This is one of the most important phases. DO NOT SKIP.**

Based on your codebase exploration, identify all underspecified aspects:

1. **Edge Cases**: What happens in error scenarios? Empty states?
2. **Error Handling**: How should failures be handled and reported?
3. **Integration Points**: Any specific requirements for integrating with existing code?
4. **Scope Boundaries**: What's explicitly out of scope?
5. **Design Preferences**: Any UI/UX or API design preferences?
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Any existing functionality that must not break?
7. **Performance Requirements**: Any specific performance constraints?

Present ALL questions in a clear, numbered list.

**WAIT for the user to answer before proceeding.**

If the user says "whatever you think is best":
- Provide your recommendation
- Get explicit confirmation before proceeding

## Current Phase: ARCHITECTURE DESIGN

Three architecture agents are designing approaches in parallel:
1. **Minimal Changes**: Smallest diff, maximum reuse
2. **Clean Architecture**: Maintainability and elegance
3. **Pragmatic Balance**: Speed + quality

After they complete, present to the user:
1. Summary of each approach (key differences)
2. Trade-offs comparison table
3. **Your recommendation with reasoning**
4. Concrete implementation differences (files, patterns)

Ask the user: "Which approach do you prefer?"

**DO NOT proceed to implementation until user selects an approach.**

## Current Phase: IMPLEMENTATION

**DO NOT START WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER APPROVAL**

The user has selected an approach. Now implement the feature:

1. **Read First**: Re-read all relevant files identified in exploration
2. **Follow Conventions**: Match existing codebase patterns exactly
3. **Incremental Progress**: Build incrementally, update todos as you go
4. **Clean Code**: Write well-documented, maintainable code
5. **Error Handling**: Include proper error handling throughout

Implementation guidelines:
- Follow the chosen architecture approach
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Consider edge cases identified in clarification

Update your todo list as you complete each component.

## Current Phase: QUALITY REVIEW

Three review agents are analyzing the implementation:
1. **Simplicity/DRY/Elegance**: Is the code clean and maintainable?
2. **Bugs/Correctness**: Are there logic errors or edge cases?
3. **Conventions/Abstractions**: Does it follow project patterns?

After reviews complete:
1. Consolidate all findings
2. Filter to issues with confidence ≥80
3. Prioritize by severity (Critical > High > Medium)
4. Present findings to user

Ask: "What would you like to do with these findings?"
- Fix all issues now
- Fix critical issues only
- Proceed without fixes

**Address issues based on user's decision.**

2. **Key Decisions**: Important architectural or implementation choices made
3. **Files Modified**: List of all created/modified files
4. **Suggested Next Steps**: What should be done next (tests, documentation, etc.)
5. **Known Limitations**: Any limitations or future improvements

Mark all todos as complete.

Present the summary clearly for the user's reference.
