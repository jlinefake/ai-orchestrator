## Current Phase: CONTEXT GATHERING

Analyze the pull request to understand its purpose:

1. **PR Description**: What does the PR claim to do?
2. **Changed Files**: What files are modified/added/deleted?
3. **Scope**: Is this a feature, bugfix, refactor, or something else?
4. **Risk Assessment**: Initial assessment of change risk (low/medium/high)

Use git diff to see the changes. Provide a summary of:
- What the PR is trying to accomplish
- List of all files changed with brief description of each change
- Initial risk assessment with reasoning

When complete, advance to the Security Review phase.

## Current Phase: SECURITY REVIEW

A security analyzer agent is reviewing the changes for vulnerabilities.

After it completes:
1. Review the security findings
2. Add any additional security concerns you identify
3. Prioritize issues by severity

Present all security issues clearly with file locations and suggested fixes.

## Current Phase: CODE QUALITY REVIEW

2. Bugs and correctness

After they complete:
1. Consolidate findings
2. Filter to issues with confidence ≥80
3. Identify any patterns in the issues

Present findings organized by file.

A test coverage analyzer is reviewing the changes.

2. Prioritize by risk (focus on severity ≥7)
3. Consider if any are blockers for merge

Present test coverage findings with specific test suggestions.

Consolidate all review findings into a comprehensive summary:

1. **Overall Assessment**:
   - Is this PR ready to merge?
   - Risk level (Low/Medium/High)
   - Confidence in assessment

2. **Blocking Issues** (must fix before merge):
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Bugs with high confidence
   - Critical test gaps

3. **Suggestions** (should fix but not blocking):
   - Code quality improvements
   - Additional tests
   - Documentation

4. **Positive Notes**:
   - What was done well
   - Good patterns followed

5. **Recommendation**:
   - APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES / COMMENT

Ask: "What action would you like to take on this PR?"
