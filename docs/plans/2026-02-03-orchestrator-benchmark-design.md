# Orchestrator Benchmark Design

> **Implementation**: See [`benchmarks/orchestrator-benchmark/`](../../benchmarks/orchestrator-benchmark/) for the harness code and [`README.md`](../../benchmarks/orchestrator-benchmark/README.md) for usage instructions.

**Goal:** Determine if AI Orchestrator produces better results than vanilla Claude CLI for software engineering tasks, particularly those with multi-file scope or requiring large context.

**Primary Questions:**
1. Does orchestrator produce more correct/complete answers?
2. Does orchestrator handle complex tasks better than single Claude?
3. Does orchestrator's advantage grow as context fills up?

---

## Task Categories

### Category A: Known-Answer Tasks (Objective)
Tasks with verifiable correct answers for objective measurement.

### Category B: Real Codebase Tasks (Subjective)
Tasks on the orchestrator repo evaluated by LLM judges.

---

## Task Suite (10 Tasks)

### Known-Answer Tasks

| ID | Task | Complexity | Verification Method |
|----|------|------------|---------------------|
| KA-1 | "Find all IPC handlers in the codebase" | Multi-file | Count match |
| KA-2 | "List all singleton services with `getInstance()`" | Multi-file | File list match |
| KA-3 | "What files import from `orchestration-handler.ts`?" | Multi-file | File list match |
| KA-4 | Inject 3 bugs into test files, ask "find the bugs" | Multi-file | Found 3/3? |
| KA-5 | "Trace a message from user input to child spawn" | Large-context | Key files mentioned |

### Real Codebase Tasks

| ID | Task | Complexity |
|----|------|------------|
| RC-1 | "Explain how model routing decides which model to use for child tasks" | Large-context |
| RC-2 | "What happens if a child instance crashes mid-task?" | Multi-file |
| RC-3 | "Review the fast-path retrieval code for edge cases" | Multi-file |
| RC-4 | "How would you add a new orchestrator command?" | Large-context |
| RC-5 | "What are all the ways an instance can fail?" | Multi-file |

---

## Evaluation Method

### Known-Answer Tasks (Category A)
- **Correctness score**: Did it find/fix all the things? (0-100%)
- **Completeness**: Any false negatives (missed items)?
- **Precision**: Any false positives (wrong items)?

### Real Codebase Tasks (Category B)
- **Dual LLM-as-judge**: Claude + Codex both score outputs
- **Blind comparison**: Judges see both outputs without knowing which is orchestrator vs vanilla
- **Scoring rubric**:
  - Completeness (0-10): Covered all relevant files/aspects?
  - Accuracy (0-10): Statements are factually correct about the code?
  - Actionability (0-10): Could you act on this answer?
- **Human spot-check**: Verify sample of judge decisions, especially disagreements

### Secondary Metrics (All Tasks)
- Total tokens used (cost proxy)
- Wall-clock time
- Number of files examined

---

## Context Pressure Testing

**Hypothesis:** Orchestrator's advantage grows as context fills up because:
- Single Claude degrades as context window fills
- Orchestrator spawns fresh children with clean context

### Context Stages

| Stage | Context Fill | Description |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Fresh | 0-10% | Task given at start of session |
| Moderate | 30-50% | After ~50k tokens of prior conversation |
| Heavy | 70-80% | After ~100k+ tokens of prior work |

### Context Resilience Metric
```
context_resilience = (heavy_score / fresh_score) × 100%
```
Higher = more resilient to context pressure.

---

## Test Matrix

Each task runs:
- 2 systems (Vanilla Claude CLI, Orchestrator)
- 3 runs per system (median for statistical confidence)
- 3 context stages (Fresh, Moderate, Heavy)

**Total runs:** 10 tasks × 2 systems × 3 runs × 3 context stages = **180 runs**

### Task Definition Format

```typescript
interface BenchmarkTask {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: 'known-answer' | 'real-codebase';
  complexity: 'single-file' | 'multi-file' | 'large-context';
  prompt: string;
  workingDirectory: string;
  // For known-answer tasks:
  expectedAnswer?: {
    files?: string[];      // expected files to find/modify
    patterns?: string[];   // expected patterns in output
    count?: number;        // expected count of items
  };
  timeoutMinutes: number;
}
```

### Result Storage Format

```typescript
interface BenchmarkRun {
  taskId: string;
  system: 'vanilla' | 'orchestrator';
  contextStage: 'fresh' | 'moderate' | 'heavy';
  runNumber: 1 | 2 | 3;

  // Output
  output: string;
  filesExamined: string[];

  // Metrics
  tokensUsed: number;
  durationMs: number;

  // Scores (filled after judging)
  knownAnswerScore?: {
    correctness: number;    // 0-100
    falseNegatives: number;
    falsePositives: number;
  };
  judgeScores?: {
    claude: { completeness: number; accuracy: number; actionability: number };
    codex: { completeness: number; accuracy: number; actionability: number };
  };
}
```

## Judging Pipeline

### Blind Evaluation Prompt

```
You are evaluating two responses to a software engineering task.
You do not know which response comes from which system.

Task: {task.prompt}

Response A:
{randomized_output_1}

Response B:
{randomized_output_2}

Score each response on:
1. Completeness (0-10): Did it cover all relevant files and aspects?
2. Accuracy (0-10): Are the statements factually correct about the code?
3. Actionability (0-10): Could someone act on this answer?

Return JSON:
{
  "response_a": { "completeness": N, "accuracy": N, "actionability": N, "notes": "..." },
  "response_b": { "completeness": N, "accuracy": N, "actionability": N, "notes": "..." }
}
```

### Agreement Tracking
- If Claude and Codex disagree by >2 points on any dimension, flag for human review
- Track overall agreement rate as quality metric for the judging process

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Harness (No API usage)
- [ ] Create directory structure
- [ ] Implement `task-loader.ts`
- [ ] Implement `vanilla-executor.ts` - spawn Claude CLI, capture output
- [ ] Implement `orchestrator-executor.ts` - spawn orchestrator instance
- [ ] Implement `context-filler.ts` - pre-fill context to target levels
- [ ] Implement result storage (JSON files)
- [ ] Basic `runner.ts` that can execute tasks

### Phase 2: Task Suite (No API usage)
- [ ] Create `task-suite.json` with all 10 tasks
- [ ] Create setup scripts for known-answer tasks:
  - [ ] KA-1: Script to count IPC handlers (ground truth)
  - [ ] KA-2: Script to list singletons (ground truth)
  - [ ] KA-3: Script to find imports (ground truth)
  - [ ] KA-4: Script to inject/remove bugs
  - [ ] KA-5: Document expected trace path
- [ ] Create context pre-fill scripts (realistic prior conversation)

### Phase 3: Judging Pipeline (Needs API calls)
- [ ] Implement `judge.ts` with Claude integration
- [ ] Add Codex integration to `judge.ts`
- [ ] Implement blind randomization
- [ ] Implement `scorer.ts` for known-answer evaluation
- [ ] Agreement tracking and human review flagging

### Phase 4: Execution (After usage reset)
- [ ] Run full benchmark suite (~180 runs)
- [ ] Monitor for failures, re-run as needed
- [ ] Estimated duration: several hours

### Phase 5: Analysis & Reporting
- [ ] Implement `reporter.ts`
- [ ] Generate per-task comparison table
- [ ] Aggregate win/loss/tie by category and complexity
- [ ] Calculate cost multiplier (orchestrator tokens / vanilla tokens)
- [ ] Plot context resilience curves
- [ ] Identify patterns: where does orchestrator win/lose?

## Expected Output

### Summary Report

```
ORCHESTRATOR BENCHMARK RESULTS
==============================

Overall: Orchestrator wins 7/10 tasks, ties 2, loses 1

By Complexity:
  Multi-file tasks:   Orchestrator +15% avg score
  Large-context tasks: Orchestrator +22% avg score

Context Resilience:
  Vanilla Claude:    85% → 72% → 58% (Fresh → Moderate → Heavy)
  Orchestrator:      87% → 84% → 79%

Cost Multiplier: 2.3x (orchestrator uses 2.3x tokens on average)

Recommendation: Use orchestrator for multi-file and large-context tasks
where quality matters more than cost.
```

### Detailed Per-Task Results

| Task | Winner | Vanilla Score | Orch Score | Cost Ratio | Context Resilience |
|------|--------|---------------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| KA-1 | Orch   | 80%           | 95%        | 1.8x       | 0.92 vs 0.71      |
| ...  | ...    | ...           | ...        | ...        | ...               |

## Notes

- Run after weekly usage reset to avoid impacting daily work
- Budget for ~180 API calls per system (360 total for execution)
- Plus judging calls: ~180 tasks × 2 judges = 360 judge calls
- Total estimated: ~720 API calls for full benchmark
